    "# Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "The objective of a TSP is to find the optimal route through a network which visits all the nodes.  This notebook is a worked example of using the Icepack TSP solver to find a solution to a given TSP problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "* **Protobuf** (Google's Protocol Buffers library) (https://pypi.org/project/protobuf/) `pip install protobuf`\n",
    "* **Requests** (HTTP Python library) `pip install requests`\n",
    "* **Plotting** (ipyleaflet) [installation instructions here](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipyleaflet)\n",
    "* Icepack API token of a key that has the Travelling Salesman Problem Solver enabled\n",
    "\n",
    "## Protocol Buffers (Protobuf)\n",
    "Developed for internal use by Google, Protocol Buffers are a flexible, efficient, automated mechanism for serialising structured data into a binary stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "The proto definition file (`.proto`) defines the messages and services which is then complied using the protocol buffer compiler (`protoc`) to create code that can then be used to read and write messages. This repo includes precompiled message streams that are compatible with `protobuf 3.6.0` and above. If you require an older version of protobuf on your sub-system, feel free to recompile the `problem_pb2.py` and `tsp_mcvfz472gty6_pb2.py` files by running your own protobuf compiler (`protoc`) against the schema files (`problem.proto` and `tsp-mcvfz472gty6.proto`) as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "`protoc --python_out=. problem.proto`\n",
    "\n",
    "`protoc --python_out=. tsp-mcvfz472gty6.proto`\n",
    "\n",
    "This generates `problem_pb2` and `tsp_mcvfz472gty6_pb2` with the version of protobuf you have installed which can then be used the serialise the api messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Protobuf Reference Materials\n",
    "* [Developer Guide](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview)\n",
    "* [Python Basics](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/pythontutorial)\n",
    "* [Python Reference](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/python-generated)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Icepack Client Portal\n",
    "The Icepack Client Portal can accessed [here](https://portal.icepack.ai).  This site gives your team access to an API key from which personal tokens can be generated to be used to access Icepack services. The site also allows for the monitoring of requests made by your team.\n",
    "\n",
    "### API Key\n",
    "All teams will initially have a single API key and, depending on your service plan, additional keys may be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each team member will need to create a personal token for each key to which they are assigned.  This token is NOT stored by Icepack and it is up to you to ensure you save the token somewhere safe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tokens can be rotated at any point.  This won't affect other team member's tokens which will remain valid.  Members with the role of Team Owner or Admin can force all team members to rotate their personal tokens while members assigned the User role will only be able to rotate their own token.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The Team Owner and Admin members can also edit the name and description of team keys as well as assign and unassign members and enable or disable Icepack services.\n",
    "\n",
    "## TSP Set Up\n",
    "The Icepack TSP service only requires the locations to be visited.  Each location requires an ID, and a pair of coordinates. For earth-routing, x and y (as cartesian coordinates) map to the location's longitude and latitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Please check the regions currently covered [here](https://docs.scrudu.io/about/regions/#readout). If your geocodes fall outside this region we will assume a zero distance between points (and an unreasonable result will follow)."

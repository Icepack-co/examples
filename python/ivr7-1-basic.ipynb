    "* using time, distance and a single capacity dimension\n",
    "* locations\n",
    "* pickup-dropoff tasks (with task times)\n",
    "* single vehicle class\n",
    "* single vehicle-cost class\n",
    "* multiple vehicles\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "This example assumes you've configured an api-key with the required services enabled (see the [portal](portal.icepack.ai) for configuration details) and that you're familiar with loading and working with protobuf models.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Model helper\n",
    "There are several common code-snippets which are useful when working with the IVR series of models, such as creating jobs, defining dimensions etc. \n",
    "We've pre-populated examples of such common functions but you're welcome to modify and update them as you see fit for your own application. These wrappers standardise the logic flow across the examples so that we can highlight the differences in functionality between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Dimensions\n",
    "For this example of the IVR7 solver, three dimensions are added - time, distance, and capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each dimension, the slackMax and tardyMax is set to determine how the dimension behaves. The slackMax provides a limit to how much dimensional quantity may be added in order to perform a task feasibly. In a typical example, like the time dimension, this refers to how much early-waiting time a vehicle may perform for a task. By contrast, the tardyMax provides a limit to how late a task may be relative to its windows. Both the slack and tardy can be costed in the solution to discourage the usage thereof.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when looking at the time dimension the slackMax value indicates how early a vehicle is allowed to arrive before a time window begins while the tardyMax value indicates how long after a time window ends that a vehicle is still permitted complete a task (depending on the value of the tardyMax this may result in a vehicle arriving after the time window closes).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dimension - Time\n",
    "This sets up the time dimension that is used for the model. The built-in units of measurement are:\n",
    "* seconds (measurementUnit = 0), \n",
    "* minutes (measurementUnit = 1),\n",
    "* hours (measurementUnit = 2), \n",
    "* and days (measurementUnit = 3). \n",
    "All time is caluclated from a baseline zero hour and will be referenced by vehicles, locations, and tasks. It is up to the user to determine this baseline and then to convert the solution time's to the real-world time equivalent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, it's easiest to assume that midnight is time zero and everything is measured relative to that. The solver only requires that windows and quantities are specified in the positive axis (so all windows should have values greater than or equal to zero)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dimension - Distance\n",
    "This sets up the distance dimension that is used for the model. The built-in units of measurement are:\n",
    "* kilometres (measurmentUnit = 4),\n",
    "* and miles (measurementUnit = 5).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dimension - Capacity\n",
    "This sets up the capacity dimension that is used for the model. This dimension does not have built-in units. This will be referenced by both vehicles and tasks."

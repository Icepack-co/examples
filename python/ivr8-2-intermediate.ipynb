    "# IVR8 Intermediate Example\n",
    "This example aims to highlight the follow:\n",
    " * demonstrate how to use compartment constraints on a particular model\n",
    " * Use a subset of the publist stops and configure a single vehicle\n",
    " * Use a simple two-rack compartment configuration to illustrate the basic assignment workings\n",
    " * Add a group-limit constraint which only permits loads on the top-rack if there is a task filling the space beneth it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "This example assumes you've configured an api-key with the required services enabled (see the [portal](portal.icepack.ai) for configuration details) and that you're familiar with loading and working with protobuf models.\n",

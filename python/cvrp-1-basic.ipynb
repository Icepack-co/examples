    "# Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP)\n",
    "\n",
    "A CVRP in an academic sense is to find the least number of vehicles which are required to service all demands at minimum cost. The way in which we emulate this is to add a large cost for using a vehicle and a smaller cost for travelling between nodes. Each vehicle is limited to the maximum amount that it can service (referred to as the capacity) and each node has a defined `quantity` for it's demand.\n",

This is because the task is assigned to a compartment. At no point is the total volume allocated to a single compartment more than the capacity of the compartment. There are 16 allocations here because there are 8 jobs, i.e. 8 pickups, 8 dropoffs. So after each pickup we can see the state of the load on the vehicle.
